The goal of the course project is to study technologies for developing computer games and create a “runner game” with their help.

To achieve this goal, the following points were implemented:
• Design the rules of the game.
• Implement the designed rules of the game using selected development technologies.
• Develop the user interface of the game, design the visual presentation and animations using ready-made components and your own.

Rules:
You endlessly move through the world and your goal is to get as further as you can. You need to avoid multiple traps and enemies on your path with the help of useful items you pick up as you go. As a character you can jump, slide, attack enemies with your sword and use items in your inventory.
Controls:
Space - Jump;
Left Mouse Button - Attack;
C - Slide;
